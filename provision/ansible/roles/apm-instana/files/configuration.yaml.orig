# Manual a-priori configuration. Configuration will be only used when the sensor
# is actually installed by the agent.
# The commented out example values represent example configuration and are not
# necessarily defaults. Defaults are usually 'absent' or mentioned separately.
# Changes are hot reloaded unless otherwise mentioned.

# It is possible to create files called 'configuration-abc.yaml' which are
# merged with this file in file system order. So 'configuration-cde.yaml' comes
# after 'configuration-abc.yaml'. Only nested structures are merged, values are
# overwritten by subsequent configurations.

# Secrets
# To filter sensitive data from collection by the agent, all sensors respect
# the following secrets configuration. If a key collected by a sensor matches
# an entry from the list, the value is redacted.

# Ignore processes
# To ignore any monitoring of certain processes, uncomment the
# com.instana.ignore section and list all process names of processes that should
# not be monitored.
# Sometimes scripts or other jobs are started through the same command, but
# only the execution of a single command should be ignored. In this case use
# arguments to specify any argument that should cause a process to be ignored.

# explicitly list the remote filesystems that shall be monitored.

#    # Pins the PHP Tracing extension to download and install to a specific

#    # The maximum number of traces the sensor is allowed to keep in the backlog

# .NET Full Framework tracing

#    # The commands issued in the script should be executed asynchronously (start /b <cmd>) in order to not
