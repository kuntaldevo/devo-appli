# At the moment this is obnoxious. I think I might be able to elimiate this with the current version of Kustomize
#BUt the problem is that ComfigMap for a number like 1 must be quoted.  Kustomize will use those quotes even if we don't want a string
# Replicas requires a number to be used.  Maybe use the replica's Kustomization instead, but trying to get this to work with only one location value has been a challenge
# The env var for MONGO_REPLICA_COUNT requires a quoted value.
#I had previously deleted this but put it back for now
