## Limits

AWS sets regional limits for many of EC2's available features.  Using this automation tool you might quickly run out of the regional default set for features like,

* VPCs
* EIPs
* EC2
* EBS

To resolve: Use the support portal to ask for the appropriate increase.  Most increases are automatic happening within 10 - 15 minutes.

To see your account's current limits for a region, view them from the EC2 portal and select limits from the left hand side.
