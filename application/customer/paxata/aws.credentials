# AWS User Profile, assuming credentials are stored locally
export profile_id="default"

# This is kind of a misnomer seeing how Dev and Prod could be separate accounts and different regions
# This export only allows for one profile_id for an entire customer and at the moment remote-init doesn't have any region
# specific configuration available to it yet.

# But there are more than one way to do this.
# I've also added a check for AWS_PROFILE in the tf-params-init.sh
